Portfolio Website (Dark Mode)

What this is
- A modern, responsive dark-mode portfolio template.
- Static site: open `index.html` in a browser to view.

Files created
- `index.html` — main page (edit your name, bio, project links, academic info, email)
- `css/style.css` — styles (dark theme, responsive grid)
- `js/script.js` — small interactivity (year, smooth scroll)

Notes about assets
- Place your profile image (the one you attached) into `assets/profile.jpg`.
- Place your resume PDF into `assets/Muhammad_Usman_Resume_Full.pdf` (or update the link in `index.html` if you keep it elsewhere).

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Replace placeholders: your name, email, project links, and academic details.
3. Add screenshots into a folder `assets/` and update the markup in `index.html` for richer visuals.
4. Put your profile photo and resume in the `assets/` folder so the site can reference them directly.

Quick local preview (recommended):
- On Windows `cmd.exe` you can run a simple Python server (if Python is installed):

```cmd
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Deployment
- Deploy to GitHub Pages by pushing the repo and enabling Pages, or use Netlify/Vercel for automatic deploys.

Next steps I can help with
- Customize copy, colors, and fonts.
- Add a contact form that posts to your email service.
- Convert to a React/Next.js project and add better SEO.

- Optimize/auto-enhance your profile photo (I can provide a script or step-by-step for local editing).

Replace placeholder emails and links with your actual data before publishing.
